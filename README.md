# Getting Started

This project was created by [Zahmoulovski](https://github.com/zahmoulovski/).

### `node server.js`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint the "Generated Password" in the console, 

Just run "node server.js" you will get a password everytime you run that command, also an email be sent to my personal email ! next time i will learn how to make an input so you can input your email haha, but if you wanna receive the email in your personal email just input manually your email address in the line "44"
